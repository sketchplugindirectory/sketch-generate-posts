# Generate Posts Sketch Plugin
Create random post elements from JSON'd RSS feeds.

# This is a WIP
I used it as a demo plugin for a talk about Sketch Plugins so some things are
cobbled together.

## Usage
There's a sample sketch file in this repo. I'll write better docs in the future,
for now:
1. Open the tester Sketch file
2. Select the group named "original post" on
either page.
3. Run the Generate Posts plugin

You should be prompted for a URL to a JSON file, and the number of posts you want.
